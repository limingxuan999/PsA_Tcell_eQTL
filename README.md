# PsA T cell eQTL Colocalization

This repository contains LD-pruned eQTL summary statistics used in the colocalization analysis for Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Each file includes the most significant SNP (best hit) per gene, derived from CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell datasets.

#Files
- `CD4_best_hit_eQTL.tsv` – best-hit eQTLs from CD4⁺ T cells
- `CD8_best_hit_eQTL.tsv` – best-hit eQTLs from CD8⁺ T cells

#Usage
These files were used for colocalization with PsA GWAS summary statistics.  
For full methods and interpretation, please refer to the associated dissertation.
